==============

The ipython notebooks in these lectures cover basic aspects of solving partial differential equations using local and global
collocation. Included in this family of methods are standard finite differences, spectral methods using Chebyshev,
Hermite, Laguerre, Fourier and Sinc basis functions, and multidimensional finite difference methods with isotropic error.
